After watching the E3 trailer for Final Fantasy XIII, my first response was "Okay, I'm buying a PS3... when I have the money". Flash forward 9 years: Final Fantasy XIII and it's sequels came out to lukewarm reviews, and made everyone question what it meant to be "Final Fantasy".

Imperfect as they are, the three XIII's succeed at least in one way: they're interesting to think about. They represent distinct and diverse approaches to game design. They have clear flaws, most of which come from not understanding the expectations of their audience.

Final Fantasy XIII in +-'s:  
-----------
\+ Graphical Quality  

>While it didn't quite achieve what was promised in the [2006 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH0OOulJKko), it was quite close. Camera angles aside, the difference between prerendered cutscenes and in-engine cutscenes came down to tiny things like hair and fingers.

\+ Innovative Battle System  

>One of the bravest decisions in the history of ever, the Paradigm Shift system managed to be fast paced, challenging and very *different*. 

\- "Innovative" Battle System  

>Naturally, such an innovative system would be divisive if not executed **perfectly**. Unfortunately:  
>
> 1. It wasn't clear to a player when they weren't doing things correctly. That is, if you understood the battle system, it was quick and exciting. If you didn't, battles were slow with little indication of why.  
>    * This was compounded futher by the fact that battle strategy went from managing *character actions* (e.g. fire > ice) to managing *the pace of battle*.
>    * Additionally, there were essentially two possible parties in battle: one with higher health, the other with higher offensive capabilities. Players who couldn't win quickly had the option of losing slower and with more futility.
> 2. Stat growth was capped by where you were in the plot. This meant you couldn't blindly grind to progress, breaking a time honored tradition of Final Fantasy games.  
>
>This meant that players were going to figure out the right strategy or they were going to have a bad time. So, a lot of people did.

\= Character Customization  

>The Crystarium system was largely a more friendly sphere-grid and was sufficient, but not spectacular.

\- Linearity / Lack of Exploration & Towns  

>In plot and level design, Final Fantasy XIII had a fractal-like linearity (brilliant for a game with the theme of choosing your own fate). Most areas had one clear path forward and few secrets to discover. Players not only lost the joy of loot, but the sense of agency that exploration afforded them.

\- Weak Story / Characters  

>No longer whimsical, heartwarming, or self-effacing. The plot elements of Final Fantasy XIII fall into the trap of being "serious":  
>
> * The main characters are *persecuted* and *forced* to come together and do-whatever-it-is-they-do.
> * Without a unifying ideal (e.g. save the world from Kefka), the interactions are often tense and unpleasant.
> * Because we never see the characters have positive interactions, it's hard to grow attached to them.
>
>Consistent with the world around them, the main characters are introduced as being frantic, irritable and unpleasant. On paper, they get "character development": each gets introduced as a well defined trope, but is revealed to have at least one contradictory trait. While players do see the character overcome their respective obstacles, we never see the humanizing moments needed to care for them.

<!-- > * Lightning: uptight and bitchy... though protective  
> * Snow: headstrong and positive regardless of context  
> * Vanille: the enthusiastic girl, but not really  
> * Sazh: Devoted father. Also black  
> * Hope: Angry kid.  
> * Fang: Uncouth rogue!
 -->

>Last of all, the plot itself lacks clear direction. We know the goal of the main characters, but the reasons why they're put into the situation that they're in are beyond convoluted.  


What Final Fantasy XIII-2 Addressed:
-------------

\+ Linearity

>Newton's Third Law proved to be a driving force in the development of XIII-2. Linearity, easily the most hated element of XIII, was addressed across the board.  
>
>Environments became more [maze-like](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Final_Fantasy_XIII-2_Map_Images?file=Academia_map_ffxiii-2_complete_guide.jpg). This time, players had a world to explore. They had the quirky tool of [Moogle Throw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orbTRhHOxQY&t=32) - which made every suspicious sparkle in the distance an opportunity for free stuff. They had monsters to fight against and with, since in this installment you could recruit them as allies.
>
>Once again, microscopic design was mirrored on a higher level with the [Historia Crux](http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/619315-final-fantasy-xiii-2/faqs/63802), the overworld-map of space-time. Because one of the dimensions that the player could travel across was *time*, players had the ability to see long term of effects of their questing and boss hunting. Players not only had agency, but symbols of agency as [gameplay elements](https://www.google.com/search?q=final+fantasy+xiii-2+giant+flan&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1259&bih=1277&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=qCsJVeTcKYKogwT7yIGYDA&sqi=2&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg) in addition to the standard multiple endings.

\+ "Innovative" Battle System

>For many the battle system of XIII was it's saving grace. But, its flaws could be potentially dealbreaking.  
>
> * In XIII, there was little stopping a player from choosing a suboptimal or simply *not valid* party. By virtue of having only 2 main characters and a monster ally, XIII-2 simultaneously limited the likelyhood of choosing a weak party and increased the number of potential options.
> * Being unable to grind - while a welcome challenge to some - only exasperated player frustration. As such, the plot-based-stat-caps were removed.

\+ Weak Story / Characters  

>The story of XIII was fundamentally two stories: the tale of Lightning's party and the creation myth of XIII's universe. At the core, each is also simple to understand. Yet few did. The story of XIII's creation myth was buryed deep in it's 'datalogs'. Without that context, the events that happen to and around the main characters seem random and meaningless.
>
>The first major shift from XIII to XIII-2 is that the major drivers of the plot are characters that we can see. Neither 'Gods' nor the concept of 'fate', the primary actors are people with faces, motivations and baggage. The characters themselves can *show* us their actions and intentions. This makes the events of XIII-2 much less of a clusterfuck and instead a story about people.
>
>It's telling that XIII-2 features none of its predecessor's party members as playable characters. And it was the right move. XIII-2's characters are much more believable. While still subject to the melodrama neccessary for a 'character arc', Noel and Serah feel more have ups and downs instead of constant tension; they have motivations that aren't 'we have to'; most of all, they spend more time revealing who they are than than developing into a different character.
