Folders
---------------

Make folders
`mkdir FOLDER`

Delete a folder
`rmdir FOLDER`

Delete a folder and everything in it
`rm -rf FOLDER`
`-r` recursive
`-f` remove all files without asking permission
`-i` ask before deleting each file

List contents of a folder
`ls [optional FOLDER]`
`-a` show hidden files
`-1` one entry per line

Move a folder
`mv FOLDER DESTINATION`

Go to a folder
`cd DIRECTORY_NAME`

Special folder names
`..`   = up a directory
`...`  = up 2 directories
`.`    = here
`~`    = user home directory
`/`    = root folder

Show current folder
`pwd`

Compare folders
`diff -q FOLDER_A FOLDER_B | sort`
`-q`    If this isn't there, it'll compare each file too


Files
---------------

Rename or move a file
`mv SOURCE_FILE DESTINATION_FILE_OR_FOLDER`

Copy a file
`cp ORIGINAL_FILE COPY_FILE_NAME`

Find a file anywhere
`ff FILENAME`
`-p` lets you use a prefix

Find a file in a particular directory [ref](https://kb.iu.edu/d/admm)
`find DIRECTORY -name FILENAME_OR_PATTERN`
Use a filename for an exact search.
Use 'Potato*.png' to match all .png files starting with 'Potato'
`-print`     Displays their paths (not needed on OSX)
`-exec cmd`  Executes a command on each result.
             Use `{}` as a placeholder for where the filename goes in the command.
             End the command with `\;`
             ex. `find . -name '*.mp3' -exec rm {} \;`
`-ok cmd`    Executes a command, but confirms

ex. Find a file and check if it contains a string (John)
`find . -name '*.txt' -exec grep "John" {} \; -print`


Populate a file with output
`COMMAND > FILENAME`

Append output to the end of a file
`COMMAND >> EXISTING_FILE`

Send a file into a command
`COMMAND < FILENAME`


Change permissions (usually, make executable)
`chmod OPTIONS FILENAME`
* go look it up




Text files
---------------

Edit with VIM
`vi FILENAME`

Edit with EMACS
`emacs FILENAME`

View a file
`less FILENAME`
Arrows		Go up and down
Space		Go to the next page
`q`			Quit
`/pattern`  Search for a pattern

View the end of a growing file
`tail -f FILENAME`

Dump a file to the console
`cat FILENAME`

Comparing files
`diff A B`
`-b`     Ignore changes to amount of whitespace
`-w`     Ignore whitespace
`-c`     Show context (3 lines default; can provide # as argument)
`-y`     Show two columns
[Reference](http://www.computerhope.com/unix/udiff.htm)

Comparing sorted files
`comm A B`
`-i`      Case insensitive sorting
`-123`    Supress the numbered column
Shows 3 columns: lines only in A, lines only in B, lines in A and B.
ex: `comm -2 A B` shows the lines in A, and the lines common to A and B.


Chaining
---------------

Chaining commands
`FIRST_COMMAND | SECOND_COMMAND`

Dumping a file into a command
`cat FILENAME > COMMAND`

Use a file as input/output
`COMMAND [OPTIONS & ARGUMENTS] < INPUT_FILE`

[advanced redirection](http://sc.tamu.edu/help/general/unix/redirection.html)
`>&` includes standard error
`>!` overwrites if it exists
Redirecting to `/dev/null` = suppressing it

_____________________________________XARGS?



Processes
---------------

show all running processes
`ps`

show your running processes
`ps -u USERNAME`

kill a process
`kill PROCESS_ID`
*use PID from `ps`
