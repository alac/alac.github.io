title: "The Upsides of Final Fantasy XIII: One Engine, Erratic Approaches"
---

After watching the E3 trailer for Final Fantasy XIII, my first response was "Okay, I'm buying a PS3... when I have the money". Flash forward 9 years: Final Fantasy XIII and it's sequels came out to lukewarm reviews, and made everyone question what it meant to be "Final Fantasy".

Imperfect as they are, the three XIII's succeed at least in one way: they're interesting to think about. They represent distinct and diverse approaches to game design. They have clear flaws, most of which come from not understanding the expectations of their audience.

Final Fantasy XIII in +-'s:  
\+ Graphical Quality  

>While it didn't quite achieve what was promised in the [2006 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH0OOulJKko), it was quite close. Camera angles aside, the difference between prerendered cutscenes and in-engine cutscenes came down to tiny things like hair and fingers.

\+ Innovative Battle System  

>One of the bravest decisions in the history of ever, the Paradigm Shift system managed to be fast paced, challenging and very *different*. 

\- Innovative Battle System  

>Naturally, such an innovative system would be divisive if not executed **perfectly**. Unfortunately:  
>
> 1. It wasn't clear to a player when they weren't doing things correctly. That is, if you understood the battle system, it was quick and exciting. If you didn't, battles were slow with little indication of why.  
> 2. Stat growth was capped by where you were in the plot. This meant you couldn't blindly grind to progress, breaking a time honored tradition of Final Fantasy games.  
>
>This meant that players were going to figure out the right strategy or they were going to have a bad time. So, a lot of people did.

\= Character Customization  

>The Crystarium system was largely a more friendly sphere-grid and was sufficient, but not spectacular.

\- Linearity / Lack of Exploration & Towns  

>In plot and level design, Final Fantasy XIII had a fractal-like linearity (brilliant for a game with the theme of choosing your own fate). 

\- Weak Story / Characters
