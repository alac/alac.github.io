title: "The Evolution of Final Fantasy XIII: Three Systems, One Plot"
---

After watching the E3 trailer for Final Fantasy XIII, my first response was "Okay, I'm buying a PS3... when I have the money". Flash forward 9 years: Final Fantasy XIII and it's sequels came out to lukewarm reviews, and made everyone question what it meant to be "Final Fantasy".

Imperfect as they are, the three XIII's succeed at least in one way: they're interesting to think about. They represent distinct and diverse approaches to game design. They have clear flaws, most of which come from not understanding the expectations of their audience.

Final Fantasy XIII in +-'s:  
\+ Graphical Quality  

>While it didn't quite achieve what was promised in the [2006 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH0OOulJKko), it was quite close. Camera angles aside, the difference between prerendered cutscenes and in-engine cutscenes came down to tiny things like hair and fingers.

\+ Innovative Battle System  

>One of the bravest decisions in the history of ever, the Paradigm Shift system managed to be fast paced, challenging and very *different*. 

\- Innovative Battle System  

>Naturally, such an innovative system would be divisive if not executed **perfectly**. Unfortunately:  
>
> 1. It wasn't clear to a player when they weren't doing things correctly. That is, if you understood the battle system, it was quick and exciting. If you didn't, battles were slow with little indication of why.  
> 2. Stat growth was capped by where you were in the plot. This meant you couldn't blindly grind to progress, breaking a time honored tradition of Final Fantasy games.  
>
>This meant that players were going to figure out the right strategy or they were going to have a bad time. So, a lot of people did.

\= Character Customization  

>The Crystarium system was largely a more friendly sphere-grid and was sufficient, but not spectacular.

\- Linearity / Lack of Exploration & Towns  

>In plot and level design, Final Fantasy XIII had a fractal-like linearity (brilliant for a game with the theme of choosing your own fate). Most areas had one clear path forward and few secrets to discover. Players not only lost the joy of loot, but the sense of agency that exploration afforded them.

\- Weak Story / Characters  

>No longer whimsical, heartwarming, or self-effacing. The plot elements of Final Fantasy XIII fall into the trap of being "serious":  
>
> * The main characters are *persecuted* and *forced* to come together and do-whatever-it-is-they-do.
> * Without a unifying ideal (e.g. save the world from Kefka), the interactions are often tense and unpleasant.
> * Because we never see the characters have positive interactions, it's hard to grow attached to them.
>
>Consistent with the world around them, characters are introduced as being frantic, irritable and unpleasant. First impressions aside, 

<!-- > * Lightning: uptight and bitchy... though protective  
> * Snow: headstrong and positive regardless of context  
> * Vanille: the enthusiastic girl, but not really  
> * Sazh: Devoted father. Also black  
> * Hope: Angry kid.  
> * Fang: Uncouth rogue!
 -->

>
>The plot itself couldn't be less clear: somehow, there's a goddess involved and she's actually the driver of the plot across games.
