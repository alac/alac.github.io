Sometimes, you think you're just upgrading. Then, a couple months later, you have the ship of thesus on your hands...

Notes on Building a Computer
----------
Read the manual(s).

If upgrading an existing machine: you may not be able to! Not easily at least. You might be restricted because of a weak power supply or a finicky motherboard.

When installing any piece, use compressed air (or an equivalent) to make sure that there isn’t dust. Dust is hard to debug!

When buying stuff:

 * CPU or heatsink upgrade -> Thermal Paste
 * GPU upgrade or additional parts -> Power Supply
 * Building from scratch -> Wifi adapter / Bluetooth adapter, if not a part of the motherboard.
 * New drives -> New SATA cables.
 * RAM is complicated. Being compatible with the motherboard isn’t as fast as the RAM being compatible with the CPU, but it might be fine for your needs. Similarly, if your motherboard supports dual or triple channels, you might get a boost from having the same kind

Putting it together:

 * Use a static wristband so that you don’t fry every thing.
 * The motherboard shouldn’t touch the case directly! It connects to mounting screws and the screws connect to the case.
 * The heatsink and cpu need a layer of thermal paste between them. A very thin layer: basically a grain of rice sized amount of paste spread out with a sandwich bag. Don’t touch either surface or the paste with your hands, since oil will make the paste less effective. Applying thermal paste will differ if you have a ‘direct contact’ heatsink. Intel’s push-pin heatsinks are insanely difficult to install.
 * For connecting the motherboard to components on the case... It might be a bit of a guessing game. The motherboard’s manual should explain the intentions of each pin and the connectors coming from the case should have labels on them as well.

After everything is connected:

 * Stress test your new components. Monitor temperature and load to make sure that everything is fine.
