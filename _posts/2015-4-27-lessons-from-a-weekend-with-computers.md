Some weekends, everything goes wrong. But you learn some stuff:

Windows 7 installations frequently lock up at 65%. But, it’s normal and goes away after 30 minutes or so.

OS X Yosemite only allows two partitions when using Boot Camp to manage a Windows installation. That is, if you want a third partition for shared files, you either need to: not use Boot Camp, use an external hard drive or SDHC, or give up.

Like most things, you can learn how to apply thermal paste on the Youtube.

If your computer refuses to boot and you take out the hard drive and find it’s not useable, there might be an upside: maybe your hard drive is the only part that was broken!
