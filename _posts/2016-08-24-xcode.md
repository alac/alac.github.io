Has there ever been a lower effort clickbait topic than IDE shortcuts, features and plugins?

Shortcuts
==========

Editor Navigation
---------

* `cmd-shift-o` = Search for a file and open in editor.  

* `ctrl-cmd-up`/`ctrl-cmd-down` = switch between .h and .m file.  

* `cmd-shift-[`/`cmd-shift-]` = move left and right in tabs.  

* `cmd-shift-left`/`cmd-shift-right` = Previous/next file.

* `ctrl` + click = Jump to definition.  

* `ctrl-6` = Search methods in this file.

Editing
---------

* `ctrl/alt/cmd-left/right` = Go to the previous or next subword/word/line.  
Note this mirrors the keyboard layout.  

* `ctrl-space` = Show completions.  
Useful for long method signatures.  

* `cmd-/` = Comment selected line.  

* `ctrl-cmd-E` = Edit all in scope.  

* `cmd-f` = Find in file. Add shift for project.  

* `alt-cmt-f` = Find and replace in file. Add shift for project.  

* `cmd-enter`/`alt-cmd-enter` = Show editor, show assistant editor (e.g. splitscreening 2 files).  

* `cmd-:` = Spell check.

'Navigator'
---------
It's the bar on the left that shows files, etc.

* `cmd-shift-f` = Find across files.  

* `cmd-alt-j` = Filter the navigator.  

* `cmd-shift-j` = Show the current editor file in the navigator.  

* `cmd-1`...`cmd-8` = Switch navigator tabs.

Build/Run
--------

* `cmd-b` = Build.  

* `cmd-r` = Run.  

* `cmd-u` = Test.  

* `cmd-shift-k` = Clean.  

* `cmd-y` = Toggle breakpoints.

Features
=============
- [Snippets](http://nshipster.com/xcode-snippets/).  
Add macros that expand to snippets.  
Great for common things like property declarations.  
- [LLDB Debugging](https://www.objc.io/issues/19-debugging/lldb-debugging/).  
LLDB is the standard debugger for XCode.  
Features range from on-the-fly variables to conditional breakpoints.  
- [Context aware search](http://holko.pl/2016/04/26/xcode-search/).  
Search definitions.  
Search call hierarchy.  
- [Regex search](http://roadfiresoftware.com/2013/12/replacing-regular-expressions-in-an-xcode-project/).  
Note that XCode 7+ uses `$1` instead of `\1` for capture groups.  
Lifesaver for API changes.  

Plugins (XCode 7.3 and below)
=============

While not long for this world, plugins allows us to extend XCode's behavior.  

* [ClangFormat-XCode](http://nshipster.com/xcode-plugins/#code-formatting-with-clangformat). If you're into having your whitespace consistent, but find that OCD is not for you get this.  

* [Polychromatic](https://github.com/kolinkrewinkel/Polychromatic). If you're frequently encountering undiscipherable walls of code, maybe color coding variables will help.  

* [VWInstantRun](https://github.com/wangshengjia/VWInstantRun). Fast iteration often means being able to test out a few lines - if only to be sure about how a construct works. If you want to be able to do this without having a testbed app open all the time, VWInstantRun is your jam.  

* [MCLog](https://github.com/yuhua-chen/MCLog). Cut through the useless logging of your co-workers by regex filtering your console log.  

Further plugins are highlighted at the always useful [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/xcode-plugins/).
