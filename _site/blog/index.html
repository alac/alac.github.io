      <p>Starcraft II came out in 2010 to all the hype that the successor to one of the most beloved games of all time should expect. Quite a lot has been said about it’s decline, but - almost 5 years later now - quite a lot of people still play and still tune in to watch Starcraft II. It certianly deserves some credit:</p>

<p>Starcraft is a game with few rules and concepts, but tremendously complex and deep. Unlike League or Dota, there</p>

<p>The part of it that I actually love, however, is the fact that you can play a beautiful game. A perfect execution of a rush strategy means something like ten minutes of a well coordinated and planned series of actions; no different from playing music. Most matches are closer to that scenario: following through on some rehearsed set of actions, which depend on the state of the game. On the other hand, sometimes players end up in situations wholly new to them. Because of that - and the fast pace of the game - players are given the opportunity to have incredible moments. Moments unlike our work or personal lives, moments where a split second realization or decision can reverse the outcome of a situation. And at the relatively low cost of potentially losing.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, you think you’re just upgrading. Then, a couple months later, you have the ship of thesus on your hands…</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-building-a-computer">Notes on Building a Computer</h2>
<p>Read the manual(s).</p>

<p>If upgrading an existing machine: you may not be able to! Not easily at least. You might be restricted because of a weak power supply or a finicky motherboard.</p>

<p>When installing any piece, use compressed air (or an equivalent) to make sure that there isn’t dust. Dust is hard to debug!</p>

<p>When buying stuff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU or heatsink upgrade -&gt; Thermal Paste</li>
  <li>GPU upgrade or additional parts -&gt; Power Supply</li>
  <li>Building from scratch -&gt; Wifi adapter / Bluetooth adapter, if not a part of the motherboard.</li>
  <li>New drives -&gt; New SATA cables.</li>
  <li>RAM is complicated. Being compatible with the motherboard isn’t as fast as the RAM being compatible with the CPU, but it might be fine for your needs. Similarly, if your motherboard supports dual or triple channels, you might get a boost from having the same kind</li>
</ul>

<p>Putting it together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a static wristband so that you don’t fry every thing.</li>
  <li>The motherboard shouldn’t touch the case directly! It connects to mounting screws and the screws connect to the case.</li>
  <li>The heatsink and cpu need a layer of thermal paste between them. A very thin layer: basically a grain of rice sized amount of paste spread out with a sandwich bag. Don’t touch either surface or the paste with your hands, since oil will make the paste less effective. Applying thermal paste will differ if you have a ‘direct contact’ heatsink. Intel’s push-pin heatsinks are insanely difficult to install.</li>
  <li>For connecting the motherboard to components on the case… It might be a bit of a guessing game. The motherboard’s manual should explain the intentions of each pin and the connectors coming from the case should have labels on them as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>After everything is connected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stress test your new components. Monitor temperature and load to make sure that everything is fine.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Some weekends, everything goes wrong. But you learn some stuff:</p>

<p>Windows 7 installations frequently lock up at 65%. But, it’s normal and goes away after 30 minutes or so.</p>

<p>OS X Yosemite only allows two partitions when using Boot Camp to manage a Windows installation. That is, if you want a third partition for shared files, you either need to: not use Boot Camp, use an external hard drive or SDHC, or give up.</p>

<p>Like most things, you can learn how to apply thermal paste on the Youtube.</p>

<p>If your computer refuses to boot and you take out the hard drive and find it’s not useable, there might be an upside: maybe your hard drive is the only part that was broken!</p>

      <p>After watching the E3 trailer for Final Fantasy XIII, my first response was “Okay, I’m buying a PS3… when I have the money”. Flash forward 9 years: Final Fantasy XIII and it’s sequels came out to lukewarm reviews, and made everyone question what it meant to be “Final Fantasy”.</p>

<p>Imperfect as they are, the three XIII’s succeed at least in one way: they’re interesting to think about. They represent distinct and diverse approaches to game design. They have clear flaws, most of which come from not understanding the expectations of their audience.</p>

<h2 id="final-fantasy-xiii">Final Fantasy XIII</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ffxiii/ffxiii_1_crop.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIII action shot" title="If only Lightning could hit all the problems in Final Fantasy XIII" /></p>

<p>What went right or wrong:</p>

<p>+ Graphical Quality</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While it didn’t quite achieve what was promised in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH0OOulJKko">2006 trailer</a>, it was quite close. Camera angles aside, the difference between prerendered cutscenes and in-engine cutscenes came down to tiny things like hair and fingers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>+ Innovative Battle System</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the bravest decisions in the history of ever, the Paradigm Shift system managed to be fast paced, challenging and very <em>different</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- “Innovative” Battle System</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Naturally, such an innovative system would be divisive if not executed <strong>perfectly</strong>. Unfortunately:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It wasn’t clear to a player when they weren’t doing things correctly. That is, if you understood the battle system, it was quick and exciting. If you didn’t, battles were slow with little indication of why.
      <ul>
        <li>This was compounded futher by the fact that battle strategy went from managing <em>character actions</em> (e.g. fire &gt; ice) to managing <em>the pace of battle</em>.</li>
        <li>Additionally, there were essentially two possible parties in battle: one with higher health, the other with higher offensive capabilities. Players who couldn’t win quickly had the option of losing slower and with more futility.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Stat growth was capped by where you were in the plot. This meant you couldn’t blindly grind to progress, breaking a time honored tradition of Final Fantasy games.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This meant that players were going to figure out the right strategy or they were going to have a bad time. So, a lot of people did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>= Character Customization</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Crystarium system was largely a more friendly sphere-grid and was sufficient, but not spectacular.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Linearity / Lack of Exploration &amp; Towns</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In plot and level design, Final Fantasy XIII had a fractal-like linearity (brilliant for a game with the theme of choosing your own fate). Most areas had one clear path forward and few secrets to discover. Players not only lost the joy of loot, but the sense of agency that exploration afforded them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Weak Story / Characters</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No longer whimsical, heartwarming, or self-effacing. The plot elements of Final Fantasy XIII fall into the trap of being “serious”:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The main characters are <em>persecuted</em> and <em>forced</em> to come together and do-whatever-it-is-they-do.</li>
    <li>Without a unifying ideal (e.g. save the world from Kefka), the interactions are often tense and unpleasant.</li>
    <li>Because we never see the characters have positive interactions, it’s hard to grow attached to them.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Consistent with the world around them, the main characters are introduced as being frantic, irritable and unpleasant. On paper, they get “character development”: each gets introduced as a well defined trope, but is revealed to have at least one contradictory trait. While players do see the character overcome their respective obstacles, we never see the humanizing moments needed to care for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- > * Lightning: uptight and bitchy... though protective  
> * Snow: headstrong and positive regardless of context  
> * Vanille: the enthusiastic girl, but not really  
> * Sazh: Devoted father. Also black  
> * Hope: Angry kid.  
> * Fang: Uncouth rogue!
 -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Last of all, the plot itself lacks clear direction. We know the goal of the main characters, but the reasons why they’re put into the situation that they’re in are beyond convoluted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="final-fantasy-xiii-2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ffxiii/ffxiii2_crop.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIII action shot" title="Suddenly, new main characters!" /></p>

<p>What was addressed:</p>

<p>+ Linearity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Newton’s Third Law proved to be a driving force in the development of XIII-2. Linearity, easily the most hated element of XIII, was addressed across the board.</p>

  <p>Environments became more <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Final_Fantasy_XIII-2_Map_Images?file=Academia_map_ffxiii-2_complete_guide.jpg">maze-like</a>. This time, players had a world to explore. They had the quirky tool of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orbTRhHOxQY&amp;t=32">Moogle Throw</a> - which made every suspicious sparkle in the distance an opportunity for free stuff. They had monsters to fight against and with, since in this installment you could recruit them as allies.</p>

  <p>Once again, microscopic design was mirrored on a higher level with the <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/619315-final-fantasy-xiii-2/faqs/63802">Historia Crux</a>, the overworld-map of space-time. Because one of the dimensions that the player could travel across was <em>time</em>, players had the ability to see long term of effects of their questing and boss hunting. Players not only had agency, but symbols of agency as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=final+fantasy+xiii-2+giant+flan&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1259&amp;bih=1277&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qCsJVeTcKYKogwT7yIGYDA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg">gameplay elements</a> in addition to the standard multiple endings.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>+ “Innovative” Battle System</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For many the battle system of XIII was it’s saving grace. But, its flaws could be potentially dealbreaking.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In XIII, there was little stopping a player from choosing a suboptimal or simply <em>not valid</em> party. By virtue of having only 2 main characters and a monster ally, XIII-2 simultaneously limited the likelyhood of choosing a weak party and increased the number of potential options.</li>
    <li>Being unable to grind - while a welcome challenge to some - only exasperated player frustration. As such, the plot-based-stat-caps were removed.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>+ Weak Story / Characters</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The story of XIII was fundamentally two stories: the tale of Lightning’s party and the creation myth of XIII’s universe. At the core, each is also simple to understand. Yet few did. The story of XIII’s creation myth was buryed deep in it’s ‘datalogs’. Without that context, the events that happen to and around the main characters seem random and meaningless.</p>

  <p>The first major shift from XIII to XIII-2 is that the major drivers of the plot are characters that we can see. Neither ‘Gods’ nor the concept of ‘fate’, the primary actors are people with faces, motivations and baggage. The characters themselves can <em>show</em> us their actions and intentions. This makes the events of XIII-2 much less of a clusterfuck and instead a story about people.</p>

  <p>It’s telling that XIII-2 features none of its predecessor’s party members as playable characters. And it was the right move. XIII-2’s characters are much more believable. While still subject to the melodrama neccessary for a ‘character arc’, Noel and Serah feel more have ups and downs instead of constant tension; they have motivations that aren’t ‘we have to’; most of all, they spend more time revealing who they are than than developing into a different character.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lightning-returns">Lightning Returns</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/ffxiii/ffxiii3_crop.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy XIII action shot" title="Definitely, not expected from the Final Final Fantasy XIII." /></p>

<p>What changed:</p>

<p>+ Linearity</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where XIII was a line and XIII-2 was a tree, LR was quite literally what you would expect <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=strongly+connected+graph&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1102&amp;bih=776&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YCQ_Ve_rKoyzogTH2oGIDg&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;dpr=2">a strongly connected graph</a>. The main plot was based around five main quests that could be done in any order, frequently interleaved with sidequests.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you might expect, the end result is a weaker plot and a stronger world. The oddities - like the roomba with a soul - and Lightning’s interactions with them make the world more memorable than any of XIII’s hallways or XIII-2’s mazes. However, the cost is having a story that it’s hard to see as anything but an excuse to wander around and endanger every species of monster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>+ Battle System</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>+ Tone</p>

<p>- The Doomsday Clock</p>
