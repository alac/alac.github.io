<p>Principle forms of interactions in Objective-C are delegate relationships, setting callback blocks, the notification system, and the observer pattern.</p>

<p>You can find real explanations of what they are in <a href="http://nshipster.com/key-value-observing/">short here</a> and in <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/7-foundation/communication-patterns/#delegation">long here</a>.</p>

<p>This post will - in an effort to be useful - demonstrate <em>misuses</em> and potential <em>problems</em>.</p>

<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-Offs</h2>
<p>For any of these patterns, you can expect that they’ll vary in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boiler plate code (‘verbose’), making your final implementation noisy.</li>
  <li>Tendency to bizarre interactions (‘subtle’), leading to tough debugging down the line.</li>
  <li>Awkwardness of memory-management and cleanup.</li>
  <li>Ability to abuse them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-value-observing">Key Value Observing</h2>
<p>If you’re completely green to KVO, go ahead and read <a href="http://nshipster.com/key-value-observing/">this</a> to get a sense of it.</p>

<p>The ideal case for KVO is one of simple systems where each layer only needs to read data from the one below it.</p>

<p>Imagine a view KVO-ing the properties of a model for updates. Or, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">MVVM</a>.</p>

<p>But with how lightweight KVO is, it can be appealing to use it within a system as well. There’s two problems with this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>EZ infinite loops.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suddenly, the timing of setting a property becomes very <em>intentional</em>.</p>

    <p>Setting it too early might trigger a KVO that changes <em>the assumptions of the rest of the current function call</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Or</em>  it gets set too early and the KVO gets triggered <em>before some state change completes</em>, leading to the KVO callback’s behavior being incorrect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can <em>create a reliance on</em> implicit assumptions.</p>

    <p>Ex: 1</p>

    <p>Suppose you have an object <code>Thing</code> with a property <code>Stuff</code> and that <code>Stuff</code> has a property <code>Junk</code>.</p>

    <p>You know that <code>Stuff</code> is readonly, so it’s safe for a consumer of <code>Thing</code> to KVO <code>Stuff</code>’s <code>Junk</code>.</p>

    <p>You commit, then a co-worker decides to make <code>Stuff</code> readwrite. Now your code has <em>subtly</em> broken.</p>

    <p>Ex: 2</p>

    <p>You’re inserting a new feature into a pre-existing system. There are two relevant pre-existing components <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

    <p>You need a callback to occur at a particular time. This happens to be when <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are in a specific state. You KVO the relevant properties to check the states of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

    <p>You commit, then a co-worker changes implementation of <code>B</code>. <em>Your co-worker can’t tell that the specific timing of <code>B</code>’s state changes are important to you</em>, and now your code has <em>subtly</em> broken.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kvo-takeaways">KVO Takeaways</h2>
<p>KVO allows you to write loosy coupled code by enabling the dependency to be one-way. However, it also allows you to write <em>implicitly</em> tightly coupled code.</p>

<p>Situationally, KVO may also be slow. Luckily, unabusive use of it is inheriently sparse and shouldn’t result in performance issues.</p>

<p>The default implementation of KVO is <a href="http://khanlou.com/2013/12/kvo-considered-harmful/">not popular</a>; it has a fugly api, and some weird lifecycle behaviors.</p>

<p>Notable alternative implementations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Facebook’s <a href="https://github.com/facebook/KVOController">KVOController</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mike Ash’s <a href="https://github.com/mikeash/MAKVONotificationCenter">MAKAVO</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="delegate-patterns">Delegate Patterns</h2>
<p>The delegate pattern takes issue with subtlety and <em>does away with it entirely</em>.</p>

<p>The message sender has a reference to a delegate object that it knows conforms to a particular protocol and it calls those methods as needed.</p>

<p>This works well for hiding the sender from the delegate and separating out the necessary details of the delegate from the rest of it’s implementation.</p>

<p>So, where does it go wrong?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The delegate pattern doesn’t make sense in situations where the objects are <em>by definition tightly coupled</em> and therefore don’t need the flexibility. Instead it obfusicates an otherwise straightforward relationship.</p>

    <p>The easy example is a class that does a large scale computation, with enough steps to warrent being split into other objects. Since a step is inheriently an implementation detail of the computation, defining that relationship as a delegate relationship is unlikely to have any value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It doesn’t scale well to multiple delegates.</p>

    <p>For simulatenous delegates, you’ll need to add some sort of boilerplate to track them (likely, a weak collection). The upside here, compared to other patterns, is that you’ll be able to do things like have a priority system for when the updates occur.</p>

    <p>For multiple kinds of delegates, you’ll likely have a lot of <em>optional protocol methods</em> or a lot of empty implementations in the delegate classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ownership relationships and delegates.</p>

    <p>In general, the delegate should be kept around via a <code>weak</code> (or <code>assign</code>) reference rather than a <code>strong</code> reference to prevent retain cycles.</p>

    <p>Stick to this since <em>happening to know</em> that delegates aren’t retained elsewhere is a <em>subtle</em> implementation detail.</p>

    <p>If the delegates aren’t retained elsewhere, then at the very least the class that hooks them up is likely an <em>okay</em> (read: less bad) place to retain them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="delegates-takeaway">Delegates Takeaway</h2>
<p>Delegates are <em>explicit</em> and therefore relatively low risk,</p>

<p>Delegates are also verbose, potentially making code harder to follow and likely <em>making you not want to use them</em>.</p>

<p>Delegates won’t ever be a wrong answer, just not necessarily the most correct answer.</p>

<h2 id="block-patterns">Block Patterns</h2>
<p>Blocks are commonly used in a APIs that require a one-off callback (e.g. completion handler for a particular request), but are often used otherwise for their absurd flexibility.</p>

<p>A block based approach can be used in most cases a delegate approach could be used. However, since the block is clearly belongs to the object that executes it, there’s no question of ownership.</p>

<p>Other upsides include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Supplying a callback block in the invocation of a method puts logically connected pieces of code together spatially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blocks are closures.</p>

    <p>You can variables in the current scope without changing the API of the reciever of the block.</p>

    <p>If the block needs to return extra data, the API of the reciever of the block doesn’t need to be modified.</p>

    <p>The block can just use a local variable with the type <code>__block</code>.</p>

    <p>Or, if an async block, set a property on a relevant object.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Used carelessly, blocks <em>will</em> cause retain cycles.</p>

    <p>A natural result of being a closure, a block object will retain any object referenced in it (especially, <em>self</em>).</p>

    <p>If an instance variable is used, the block will retain <em>self</em>!</p>

    <p>Avoid either by making a <code>__weak</code> variable and referencing that in the block instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘nil’ blocks will cause crashes.</p>

    <p>Due to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14703717"><em>reasons</em></a>, attempting to invoke a nil block will cause a crash.</p>

    <p>This is particularly sad because it’s the exception to the rule as far as the behavior of nil.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Block syntax is <a href="http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com/"><em>this confusing</em></a>.</p>

    <p>It roughly mirrors function pointers in C. For whatever that’s worth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s very subtle that the <em>block object provides the closure behavior</em>.</p>

    <p>The block object retains the local variables used in the block. If the block is deallocated during it’s execution, these variables will be <em>zombies, even in ARC</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar to <em>delegates</em>, block pattern APIs don’t lend themselves to handling the situation that multiple blocks need to be called for the same action.</p>

    <p>You can still work around this by taking an array of blocks or combining blocks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-takeaways">Block Takeaways</h2>
<p>Used carelessly, blocks will leak memory and rain crashes.</p>

<p>However, if you’re confident in your understanding of block mechanics, they can drastically simplify the code you write.</p>

<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>

<ul>
  <li>unregister or crash</li>
  <li>untyped payload</li>
</ul>
