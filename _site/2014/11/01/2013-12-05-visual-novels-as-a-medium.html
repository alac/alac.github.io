		Visual Novels: The w's of visual novels as a medium?

	<p>There’s an interesting dynamic in entertainment.  People have their preferred forms of consuming it: books and poetry long ago, television and film relatively recently, and exeedingly recently, Youtube clips and Video games. The medium will differ, but what is gained usually does not.</p>

<p>The genres stay the same. It’s not just the movies adapted from screenplays adapted from books based on real life that cross mediums. Or, the vague concept of romance that is supposed to be shared between “More Than Words”, Titanic and Emma.</p>

<p>The climax of “Exit Music (For A Film)” isn’t at all about the mental breakdown of a teenage boy, but in the end I am just as convinced that the world has just betrayed me as I was in the last chapters of The Catcher In The Rye (I was 12, but it felt real.). </p>

<p>The desperation of ‘Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven’ is ultimately a PG-rated version of the feeling of listening on ‘Lua’ alone in the middle of the night, whispered into your headphones.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that there aren’t differences between mediums.</p>

<p>For one, older forms of entertainment tended to be less immediate; classical music and poetry are both initially pleasant and yet highly demanding. You followed the tension in the melody and tried to escape from the rabbit holes between metaphors. Novels, like a long hike, can be a test of endurance until you’ve grown accustomed to them.</p>

<p>As society progressed, we’ve moved on to three hour movies and half-hour sitcoms; things that are easier to fit in after a long day; things that only demand that we keep our eyes open. And now, we have Youtube; it only demands five minutes of our time at a time; a five minutes that can be any time, really.</p>

<p>None of the above is really so surprising. I vastly prefer music over any other form of entertainment and, to me, it’s clearly due to another unsurprising fact: different mediums are better at conveying different things.</p>

<p>It’s fairly well established that music is about tension. In jazz, it’s the tension between what is expected in more traditional music and what the musician can get away with. In pop songs, it relies less on context and, instead, about expectations within the same song. The bassline repeats, except every 4th bar there’s a extra note. Maybe at some point the rest of the band stops. Maybe an acoustic guitar starts playing. The effect achieved, sometimes, is no more than a pleasant smile. But, really, the equisite moments are the ones where that eight second section that you heard at the beginning of the song comes back at the very end, except this time, you feel as though you’ve been lifted up just from hearing it. The whole song has been engineered to build and control this tension, and finally you’re rewarded with a sense of relief.</p>

<p>Books, on the other hand, are less direct. This barrier between the written word and it’s consumption directly leads to it’s two major strengths. The first is that they can convey anything that could be put into words: from the tedius repetition in A Portrait of a Lady to the many thought processes of The Sound and The Fury to the rapid fire dialog of a particular scene of Brave New World. The second is that, while we certainly ‘experience’ it, the actions of book happen only in the reader’s mind. The reader is aware of the acts performed and strung along as the writer desires, however what might offend the sensibilities of an individual in person is instead regarded as a hypothetical (as twisted as it might be). This strength allows us to have books like The Things They Carried and Lolita, which if they were instead only films, would likely be too difficult to validate and even harder to watch.</p>

<p>Visual mediums on the other hand introduce an intermediate step: the artist. That is, instead of a reader conjuring what an ‘awed face’ is and accepting it as fact, an artist or actor is tasked with created a face that embodies ‘awe’. Then the viewer’s resposibility is to recognize that. This intermediate step allows higher bandwidth communication - that is, the potential for more expressiveness - and the possibility for greater error. Because of this expressiveness, it becomes harder to quantify their merits; there is no more objective a proof of Leo being a great actor than being able to say that it was hard to watch What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. And, yet, we all know bloody well that it works. We feel it without requiring any particular taste for ‘that kind of thing’, as if there was a ‘retarded-little-brother’ type of film buff.</p>

<p>So, what exactly happens at the literal intersection between books and visual mediums? Specifically, what is the value of the Visual Novel? Why have a narrative with images? Why have a narrative with choice? What does it lend itself to?</p>

<p>In terms of convience, it’s certainly a step backwards.</p>

<p>What do you say? What do you show?</p>
