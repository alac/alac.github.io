<p>Starcraft II came out in 2010 to all the hype that the successor to one of the most beloved games of all time should expect.</p>

<p>It’s hard to tell which is more impressive: the fact that it’s still around or that people expected so much more.</p>

<!---

<h2 id="starcraft-to-the-world">Starcraft To The World</h2>
<p>It’s been called the Korea’s National Sport.</p>

<p>It’s been called the hardest game in the world.</p>

<p>But, what Starcraft is known for being the FASTEST game. People are intimidated by the ‘mechanical’ requirement to play. And it’s a fair thing to say. Playing Starcraft well usually means playing as fast as your opponent. Some Starcraft players are former pianists, so that’s the approximate level that your hands need to be able to move at. Obviously, this is only really true at the highest level, but people would rather be nothing than having a chance to be the best.</p>

<h2 id="starcraft-the-game">Starcraft The Game</h2>
<p>A game of Starcraft goes like this: build an economy, build an army and defeat your opponent.</p>

<p>A lot of people see the game as reducing to building the right units to defeat your opponent’s units. I’ve never seen it this way because it ignores <em>how much you have</em> in order to emphasize <em>what you have</em>.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ve thought of it as:</p>

<p>+ A game about speed…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I remember frantically clicking in my early games vs Medium AI and being blown away by how often I would die to the classic 2 marines and a marauder push.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eventually, I just decided to practice one strategy (3 Rax Stim + Combat Shields) and learned to survive the early game. At which point, Starcraft became</p>
</blockquote>

<p>+ A game about economy…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Better economy -&gt; Larger army -&gt; #winning. In theory, at least. This was the point in time that I would do one of two things: camp the opponent’s third base and snipe it as it was put down OR secretly take a base and hope my opponent never finds it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This worked for a good week until my friends realized that I did this all the time. So, they’d rush me and it was … uhh, not fun. This logically leads to the next step</p>
</blockquote>

<p>+ A game about timings…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time matters in a variety of ways in Starcraft.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s being aware of the ways that your opponent can try to kill you and just being sure that whatever army they attack with, you, at that time, will have enough to stop them (Lesson learned: protoss can kill you at any time).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s also the flow of the game: Zergling Speed finishes (Zerg in control), Hellions come out (Terran in control), Roaches come out (Zerg in control), Stim + Medivacs finish (Terran in control)… This resulted in quite a lot of games based around bizzare timings: 2-2 upgrade rushes, the 1 seige tank push, the 1 medivac push. It was a lot of fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, what happened more and more were games that I would fall way behind in the beginning, but find <em>some</em> way to win</p>
</blockquote>

<p>+ A mysterious game…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early in Starcraft 2: Heart of the Swarm, I played one of the most interesting games I’ve ever played.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We both got up to three bases pretty quickly and deflected each other’s harassment deftly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The my opponent dropped his entire army in my base and I cleaned it up, but lost all of my production.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the next minute or so, he could make an army and I could not. I thought I would lose.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, two things occurred to me: 1. I needed to buy time to build an army 2. I needed to make a different army since if we had the same kind, but I had less, I’d obviously lose.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I sent out the only army I had (a medivac and a few marines) to buy time. Then built only hellions, which could also be used to buy time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twenty minutes later, I won with an almost exclusively hellion army after killing almost all his workers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>+ A game about control…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ultimately, Starcraft 2 is a game about finding a way to get in control of your opponent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can rush or win a fight to bully their army directly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can harass or expand early to put them on a timer to either expand themselves or attack before you get too far ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If they’re aggressive, then you can defend and gain a lead as a result.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if you’re really good, you can do something unexpected to disrupt their play.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="starcraft-to-me">Starcraft To Me</h2>
<p>Starcraft is complex. Managing an economy is a thinly veiled spreadsheet, but one that has to be adjusted in real time.</p>

<p>Starcraft is taxing. There’s plenty to do in your own base and even more to do to your opponent. Making the correct call as to what deserves your attention now is satisfying.</p>

<p>Starcraft is a difficult game that comes with the opportunity to play a <em>beautiful game</em>.</p>

<p>A perfect execution of a rush strategy means something like ten minutes of a well coordinated and planned series of actions; no different from playing music.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes players end up in situations wholly new to them. Because of that - and the fast pace of the game - players are given the opportunity to have incredible moments. Moments, unlike our work or personal lives, moments where a split second realization or decision can reverse the outcome of a situation.</p>
