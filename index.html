            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm currently a software engineer at Pocket Gems in San Fransisco, where I've been since 2012. Initially, I worked on the implementation and optimization of features on Paradise Cove and Animal Voyage. During this time, I also began mentoring junior developers.
            <p>In mid-2013, I became the lead client developer of Episode: Choose Your Story. I singlehandedly designed and maintained the application until it's launch in January 2014. While I've stepped down as lead developer on Episode, I continue to contribute to the project. I specialize in adding features without breaking things and refactoring before things become unsustainable.
            <p>Before Pocket Gems, I studied Computer Science and Applied Math at U.C. Berkeley. At Pocket Gems, I study a rolling window of chapters from Code Complete and other software engineering books. Recently, I've started including books about team dynamics in my rotation.
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy being facetiously pedantic, cooking, playing Starcraft 2, and thinking up ways to use code to improve my personal life.
