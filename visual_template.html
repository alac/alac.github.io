	<h1>Salvation in Bakemonogatari</h1>

	"Save you? I can't do that. You're the one who can save yourself, young lady."

	<h2>[About the Show]</h2>
	Bakemonogatari is a story about a boy. Boy meets girl. Girl has supernatural problem. Boy has self-esteem issues and has a supernatural secret(!) He decides to help her. Repeat until you run out of female cast members.


	<h2>[Relevant Spoilers; i.e. lady problems]</h2>
	We'll call 'boy' Araragi-kun from this point on.

	<h3>A Crab's Weightlessness</h3>
	The first girl we meet is Hitagi. She is assertive, and what we would generally refer to as 'crabby'. She also weighs ten kilograms.
	Her backstory reveals that she was once completely normal, if a little exceptional. In middle school, she was described as being beautiful, smart-but-the-smartest and sociable. She had loving parents and was financially well off. However, Hitagi came down with a serious illness and her mother looked to a cult for solace. As she gets deeper into the cult, her mother slowly gives up her family: first their financial stability, then the safety of her daughter.
