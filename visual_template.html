<h1>Salvation in Bakemonogatari</h1>

"Save you? I can't do that. You're the one who can save yourself, young lady."

<h2>[About the Show]</h2>
Bakemonogatari is a story about a boy. Boy meets girl. Girl has supernatural problem. Boy has self-esteem issues and has a supernatural secret(!) He decides to help her. Repeat until you run out of female cast members.


<h2>[Relevant Spoilers; i.e. lady problems]</h2>
We'll call 'boy' Araragi-kun from this point on.

<h3>A Crab's Weightlessness</h3>
The first girl we meet is Hitagi. She is assertive, and what we would generally refer to as 'crabby'. She also weighs ten kilograms.
Her backstory reveals that she was once completely normal, if a little exceptional. In middle school, she was described as being beautiful, smart-but-the-smartest and sociable. She had loving parents and was financially well off. However, Hitagi came down with a serious illness and her mother looked to a cult for solace. As she gets deeper into the cult, her mother slowly gives up her family: first their financial stability, then the safety of her daughter.
Traumatized, Hitagi is left unable to cope and, like anyone would, wishes that she didn't have to deal with the pain. And so, a spirit hears her out, taking both her emotional and phyisical weight.
While she no longer has the strain of her emotional trauma, she's left with another problem to deal with: her weightlessness. In constant fear of someone discovering her condition, she becomes distant, afraid and violent. She is unable to connect with those around her.
Through Araragi-kun's supernatural connections, Hitagi's condition is diagnosed: she realizes that her physical weightlessness is a symptom of her emotional trauma. In particular, it's a symptom of the bandaid solution that she had been using to deal with her emotional trauma, pretending that it didn't happen. When she confronts the spirit, she thanks it for helping her up to this point, but asks it to stop so that she can resume living a normal life. A life without a 'horrible secret'.

<h3>A Lost Snail</h3>
Mayoi is a lost elementary aged girl who simply cannot find her way home. The exposition for her is fairly straightforward: Mayoi's parents went through a nasty divorce and, in ensuing years, she eventually forgot her mother entirely. Upset by this, one day she decides to visit her mother, but never makes it there, becoming something of a wandering spirit. Her resolution comes when Araragi and Hitagi finally guide her home.

A Vengeful Monkey
Kanbaru was an average girl and she did not like it. One day, she falls into possession of a "monkey's arm" and, acting out her jealousy, the arm attaches itself to her and begins a rampage, violently attacking anyone that might threaten her relative worth. The resolution here comes when the attacks against Araragi, while gory and painful, prove not to be a deterrent. Because he's a vampire.

A Bullied Snake
Nadeko is a middle school girl who finds herself possessed by a snake. She was the target of some mystery boy's affection and, upon turning him down, is cursed by the fans of this boy. When the main character steps in, he performs an exorcism (?) and extracts the spirit from her.

A Stressed Cat
Hanekawa is a perfect girl; she gets the best grades; she's always helpful, polite and kind. She never asks for anything. She is the unwanted child of a past marriage and, determined to not be a bother, she's refuses to acknowledge her needs. The facade she presents the world with leaves her stressed out of her mind. As such, the spirit of a cat decides to help relieve her stress for her, by attacking people. The problem of her attacking people is only resolved by the cat spirit's power being drained by that of our resident vampire.


[Who Has Been Saved]
From the perspective of the afflicted, most of the apparitions are actually benign. Hitagi, Kanbaru and Hanekawa outright benefit from their existence, although each situation results in negative side effects: Hitagi's fear of others and the harm caused to others by Kanbaru and Hanekawa. Mayoi is cursed to wander endlessly and to lure others into the same trap, but being allowed to search forever does lead to her being able to find her way eventually. In this sense, we can think of her as being 'saved', at least from this. Nadeko is the only character who appears to be entirely a victim and she is saved from her possession.

In all cases, the supernatural symptoms of each conflict are resolved in some way or another, but considering root causes no one is 'saved'. The jealousy of Kanbaru persists without an outlet, the stress of Hanekawa still needs to be closely monitored, and the bullying of Nadeko goes on. Mayoi's situation is better, having found peace, but being dead hardly makes that a win. With Hitagi, not only does her crabbiness get resolved but so does her internal conflict. Notably, while her situation finally does get resolved, Araragi stands idly on the sidelines. Rather than being saved, Hitagi saves herself.


[The Difference Between Saving Yourself and Not]
One distinguishing element of the writing in Bakemonogatari is that each character has a certain set of social masks. Araragi-kun is reserved with his peers, but quite the opposite when interacting with the younger counterparts he finds in Mayoi and Nadeko. Initially, Kanbaru presents herself to Araragi-kun as an admiring underclassmen; later, she is about as aggressive as one can be.

The concept of the social mask is particularly important because the way that a character presents herself to the world is restricted by how her problems allow her to. That is, the obvious: your insecurities determine how vulnerable you'll allow yourself to be. Hanekawa refuses to show any weakness because, even when she's perfect, she isn't wanted at home. Similarly, the afflicted Hitagi refuses to allow anyone to get close for fear that they'll discover her problem.

Soon after her story arc ends, she gains the distinction of being the only cast member that is both capable of hiding behind a social mask when playing along with other cast members and capable of discarding it when necessary. Much of her interactions with the main character are driven by this change.

Contract Girlfriend
Immediately after her arc, Hitagi comes to the main character with a proposition: she intends to find a way to repay the boy that reached out to her. Thoughts racing through his head, he asks her what she has in mind. She asks him if he wants a girlfriend. "What if I say yes?" " Then you'll have a girlfriend." His eyes go wide and there is a pause before he replies, "No." Intrigued, but morally opposed to the concept of being an arranged couple of sorts, he rejects her thinly veiled attempt to ask him out.

Free of her personal affliction, Hitagi reaches out to the main character under the guise of grateful heroine. However, the act of doing so muddles her intentions and protects her from being truely vulnerable.

Child Hater
While Mayoi is the central character of the her arc, most of the dialog and the inevitable resolution rests on the shoulders of Hitagi. From the moment that Hitagi and Araragi come across the young Mayoi, she becomes distant and unabashedly plays the part of someone that dislikes children. Hours later, she tells us the true reason that she behaved this way: she couldn't see Mayoi at all and was afraid that it was a symptom of still being afflicted. With that statement, Hitagi and Araragi are able to determine the nature of the situation and resolve it.

“Like I said, I couldn’t say anything. I just couldn’t. When you were seeing something I could not, I naturally assumed that I was the one that was wrong.”

Having learned the value of honesty, Hitagi propositions the main character again:

“I do not think this is anything quite as cheap as love at first sight and I am not patient enough to build up all the necessary groundwork. However, I still feel a desire to put effort into loving you, Araragi-kun.”

And his response:

After a few seconds, I spoke to Senjougahara.
“I say a condition, but I guess it’s more of a promise...”
“A promise? What would that be?”
“Senjougahara, never, ever again pretend to see something you do not see or pretend not to see something you do see. Never again. If anything seems odd, say so. Don’t try to be considerate. Due to what we’ve experienced and what we know, we will likely have to bear this burden for the rest of our lives. We know of these things’ existence, so promise me you will tell me on the spot if it seems there is a discrepancy in how we view something.”
“I promise.”
