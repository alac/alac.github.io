Observations
-----------

\* There's no instructions.

> However, because there's no other options, you quickly figure things out: This is a game where by fulfilling needs, you gain stuff and unlock more needs.

\* As you advance, your needs only grow.

\* Fulfilling a need sometimes comes at a cost.

> All actions in game are equivalent, they're just button presses. But, giving up 4 experience is much easier than giving up a friend.

> Why? _Because the player knows what that's like. And our real life aversion to that bleeds into the game._

\* It gets repetitive. The player's payoff is seeing the next formula that the game spits out.

> As the game goes on, the requirements become more demanding and you may end up just blindly clicking the things that help you advance.

> _This is literally the life of a disciplined person: letting some needs go unfulfilled for the sake for growth._

> I didn't realize at first that you could have multiple actions occur simultaneously. Once I did, I started getting lost with everything that was going on... which is familiar.
