Virtue's Last Reward is a puzzle adventure game, interleaving brainteasers, long segments of dialog and the glorious plot branch.

Spoilers all day.

Background
-----------
_Virtue's Last Reward_ is the sequel to _9 Doors, 9 Persons, 9 Hours_.

_999_ was mechanically straightforward: puzzle, story, branch, repeat. As the plot progressed, it revealed one twist: a fun piece of pseudoscience called _morphogenic fields_. 

The idea is that a _morphogenic field_ is a medium allowing two individuals to communicate telepatically. One person writes thoughts to the field and another reads them.

As the player goes down one plot branch, hits a dead end, then starting from scratch, but with more knowledge... The player is able to solve puzzles that were previously impossible.

Eventually, the game reveals that the player _is the morphogenic field_, conveying information between versions of the main character across playthroughs.

The Twists of VLR
-----------
The obvious twist of VLR - the one that appears in marketing material - is that characters are pitted against each other, prisoner's dilemma style. You still escape, but without the gradual warm fuzziness of becoming familiar with the rest of the cast.

Correspondingly, the _actual twist_ accomodates how much more isolated this makes each individual character: each characters consciousness remains the same across each of the player's playthroughs. That is, when the player hits a game over or gets to a puzzle that they can't solve yet, then starts again from scratch, each character's consciousness jumps to an alternate timeline.

Payoff: Non-linear character interactions
-----------
Suppose two characters A and B.

We know that in timeline 1, A chooses betray while B chooses ally.
We know that in timeline 2, B chooses betray while A chooses ally.

Now suppose that A experiences 1, then 2 and B experiences 2, then 1.

Neat, their interactions have a cross-dependent loop.

Add another layer: there's a player that controls A and chooses the ordering of timelines.

Now, suppose that B will have already experienced the other ordering of events:
If the player chose ally, then they'll be betrayed by a character B who wanted revenge from being betrayed during the last run.
If the player chose betray, then they'll be allyed by a character B who assumed they could trust character A from the last run.

In an odd way, this allows for _non-deterministic character development_. By choosing the order of character B's interactions, the player is allowed to choose between their development being one of becoming more callous or becoming kinder.
