Summary
-----------
You should really play the game, but obviously, I can't discuss it without explaining what happens.

Davey, who also serves as the narrator, guides the player through a series of games created by someone named 'Coda'. The game grow from experiments made while learning to large complex environments with characters and dialog trees.

But, the levels have these similarities that Davey won't allow going unnoticed: a prison-like asthetic, dialog that centers around uncertainty and isolation, a puzzle involving two doors, mechanics that prevent parts of the level from being experienced and visual elements like lightposts.

As the player progresses through the levels, the narrative that Davey presents paints an image of Coda that gradually grows more dire. Someone who expresses themselves through creating games, games whose primary message is one of distance and being unable to connect.

The climax of the Beginner's Guide occurs during the last level that Coda shares with Davey. One in which he severs ties with Davey, expressing how Davey's reactions and attachment to his games ultimately 'poisoned' his relationship with them.


Thoughts
-----------
Like many good books, The Beginner's Guide isn't about what happens, but the perspective that it takes on the events that do happen. This isn't about Coda's games or the experience of playing them, this is about Davey's experience with Coda's games (his experience playing them, _and_ how he presents them to the player).

That is, if they are in fact _still_ Coda's games. Davey reveals early on that he doesn't particularly care for Coda's authorial intent: where Coda would intentionally make something tedious or outright impossible, Davey _modifies the code_ so that the player can experience what Coda made _but intended the player to not experience_.

During Coda's letter to Davey, he asks if Davey 'will stop adding lightposts' to his levels. It's clear at this point that The Beginner's Guide is a [frame game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story); through the intermediary lense of Davey, we can no longer tell the difference between the real Coda and the Coda that Davey wants us to see.


(Nevermind that in real life Coda is an invention of the real life Davey.)

The first level of the game is a modified Counterstrike map. A normal map with random blocks floating around - the kinds of things one would add when learning how modify a level. Even here, Davey interprets these blocks as having a conscious meaning; their randomness breaks the suspension of disbelief that the player is accustomed to, making them consciously aware that they're experiencing something that another human being created.

This is an example of one of the most satisfying conceits of The Beginner's Guide: every situation in which Davey the Character is finding meaning where there is none, is also a situation that Davey the real life creator of The Beginner's Guide had to invent.

Anyways, out of the gate, Davey the Character is already betraying his desperation for meaning and his willingness to project it into Coda's work.

In the game, he tells you each one as you encounter them. Not until the end does Davey the character consider simplier, less dramatic explanations.

Maybe Coda just likes the Door puzzle and making prison games.

Maybe Coda is just copy-pasting things because, while he discards the old games, he still wants to keep those around.

Maybe Coda is using them as placeholders.

Maybe Coda isn't in a terrible place emotionally, maybe he's just very very good at expressing something that he sometimes feels.

Final Thoughts

The buggiest game I've played on Steam has ended up being entirely worth it.

In two hours, The Beginner's Guide asked more questions than most other games I've played and made me feel more uncomfortable than almost all of them.

It puts a spotlight on the relationship between the audience and the creator, the relationship between the creator and the act of making games, and the relationship between the audience and the games themselves.
